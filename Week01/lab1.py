# Defining Variables: 
my_array = [1, 4, 7, 9]

# Order of Operations
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4

# Fully bracketed version of e = a * c - b / d
e1 = (a * c) - (b / d)

# Fully bracketed version of e = a - b ** c // d + a % c
e2 = ((a - ((b ** c) // d)) + (a % c))

# Formatting
temperature = 32.6
print("The temperature today is: {:.3f} degrees Celsius".format(temperature))

# Common Functions
userAge = int(input("Enter your age: "))
age_adjusted = userAge + 22
print("Now showing the shop items filtered by age:", age_adjusted)
